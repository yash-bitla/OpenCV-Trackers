# OpenCV-Trackers

- This repository consists of the implementation of openCV tracking algorithms for the Object Detection and Counting Challenges in Real World Street Monitoring: Case
Study of Homeless Encampments.
- Unlike the basic openCV tracking algorithm implmentations in https://learnopencv.com/object-tracking-using-opencv-cpp-python/ which has a static camera, this alogrithm can be used to track multiple objects using a non-static (moving) camera.
